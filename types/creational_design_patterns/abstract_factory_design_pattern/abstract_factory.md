# Abstract Factory Pattern Explained Simply

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** helps you create **families of related objects** without specifying their exact classes. Instead of creating each object separately, you create a whole set of related objects that fit together nicely.

## Example: UI Themes

Imagine you want to build a graphical interface that supports different **themes**:

- A **Light Theme** with light buttons, checkboxes, and text fields.
- A **Dark Theme** with dark buttons, checkboxes, and text fields.

Using the Abstract Factory Pattern:

- You define an **abstract factory** with methods to create buttons, checkboxes, and text fields.
- You create **concrete factories** for Light and Dark themes.
- Each concrete factory creates the right themed components.
- The client code just asks the factory for components without worrying about which theme is used.

This way, you can switch themes easily by swapping the factory.

## Why Use Abstract Factory?

- **Consistency:** Ensures a set of related objects (like all UI components) match in style or purpose.
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new families (e.g., a new Blue Theme) without changing existing code.
- **Abstraction:** The client code uses abstract interfaces and doesnâ€™t depend on specific classes.

## Summary

- The Abstract Factory Pattern is about creating **related groups** of objects using a single interface.
- You define **abstract products** (e.g., `Button`, `Checkbox`), and **concrete products** for each variant (e.g., `DarkButton`, `LightButton`).
- You switch between families by changing the factory, not individual objects.
