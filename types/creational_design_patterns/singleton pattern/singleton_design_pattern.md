# Singleton Pattern

The **Singleton Pattern** is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has **only one instance** and provides a global point of access to it. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## When to Use It?

- You need only one instance of a class (e.g., database connection, logging system).
- You want to control access to shared resources.
