# Builder Pattern Explained Simply

The **Builder Pattern** is a design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. It allows you to create different types and representations of an object using the same construction process.

---

## Why Use the Builder Pattern?

- When an object needs to be created in multiple steps.
- When an object can have many configurations or optional fields.
- When the construction process must be separated from the representation.

## Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you're building a **burger** at a fast-food restaurant. You can choose:

- Type of bun (white, whole wheat)
- Type of patty (beef, chicken, veggie)
- Toppings (lettuce, tomato, cheese, pickles)

Even though all burgers are created using the same process, the **final result can vary** depending on what ingredients you pick.

## How It Works

1. **Product Class:** The complex object that needs to be built (e.g., `Burger`, `House`, `Car`).
2. **Builder Interface:** Declares methods to build the parts of the product.
3. **Concrete Builder:** Implements the builder interface and assembles the parts.
4. **Director (Optional):** Controls the order of the building process.
5. **Client:** Uses the builder to construct the desired object.

## Example Scenario: Building a Computer

You might want to build different types of computers:
- A **Gaming PC** with high-end components.
- An **Office PC** with basic specifications.

Each type of computer can be built step-by-step:
- Set CPU
- Set RAM
- Set storage
- Set GPU

The **Builder Pattern** allows you to build both configurations using the same construction steps, just with different values.

## Benefits

- **Step-by-step control:** You can build parts one by one.
- **Different representations:** You can reuse the same process to build different versions.
- **Readability:** Code becomes more expressive and easier to understand.

---

## Summary

- Use the Builder Pattern when object construction is complex or needs to be done in steps.
- It separates **how to build** an object from **what the object is**.
- Makes your code more modular, readable, and flexible.
