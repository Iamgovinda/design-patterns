# Introduction to Creational Design Patterns

**Creational design patterns** help programmers create objects in a flexible and efficient way. Instead of creating objects directly, these patterns provide methods to control **how and when** objects are made. This makes the code easier to manage and change.

## Example 1: Singleton Pattern  
Imagine you want only one connection to a database in your whole app. The Singleton pattern ensures there is **just one instance** of that connection.

## Example 2: Builder Pattern  
Think about ordering a pizza where you choose the size, crust, and toppings step by step. The Builder pattern helps you create complex objects like this by adding parts one at a time.

## Example 3: Factory Method Pattern  
Suppose you want to create different types of vehicles (car, bike, truck), but you donâ€™t want your code to know the exact type in advance. The Factory Method pattern lets you create the right vehicle without specifying the exact class.
