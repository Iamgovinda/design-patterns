# Design Patterns

This repository provides comprehensive explanations and practical implementations of commonly used **software design patterns**. Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design. Understanding and applying them improves code **maintainability**, **scalability**, and **readability**.

## 📚 What’s Inside?

This repository covers a variety of design patterns, categorized by their purpose and behavior. For each pattern, you'll find:

- ✅ **Simple, human-readable theory** with real-world analogies  
- ✅ **Python code examples** demonstrating implementation  
- ✅ Use-case scenarios to understand when and why to use each pattern  
- ✅ Markdown documentation for easy reading and reference

## 🏗️ Patterns Covered So Far

### Creational Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Factory Method Pattern**  
  Create objects through a factory method, letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

- **Abstract Factory Pattern**  
  Create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- **Prototype Pattern**  
  Create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

- **Builder Pattern**  
  Construct complex objects step by step, allowing different representations.

> More patterns (like Singleton, Adapter, Strategy, etc.) coming soon...

## 💡 Why Use Design Patterns?

- **Promote best practices** in software architecture
- Make your code more flexible and extensible
- Improve team collaboration by using common vocabulary
- Solve problems with proven approaches
